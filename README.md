# Clinic-Booking-System

## Description

This project is a **Clinic Booking System** built entirely using **MySQL**. It serves as a backend relational database for managing appointments, doctors, patients, medical services, and specializations. The system handles key operations such as:

- Booking and managing appointments
- Managing doctor specializations
- Recording services rendered to patients
- Automatically handling related deletions using foreign key constraints

This system is designed to mimic the real-world workflows of a small to mid-sized clinic.
